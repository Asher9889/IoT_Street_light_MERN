| 1️⃣      | User opens a webpage and clicks "ON" or "OFF" button                         | Frontend (HTML/JS)    | 🔸 Basic HTML & JavaScript               |
| 2️⃣      | Button click sends `POST /set-command` to the backend server                 | Web Server (API)      | 🔸 Node.js, Express, HTTP, REST API      |
| 3️⃣      | Server receives the command and stores `"ON"` or `"OFF"`                     | In-memory or database | 🔸 Node.js state / MongoDB (optional)    |
| 4️⃣      | ESP32 + SIM900A module sends `GET /latest-command` to server every 1s        | ESP32 + SIM900A       | 🔸 AT Commands, C++, UART communication  |
| 5️⃣      | Server responds with `"ON"` or `"OFF"`                                       | Web Server            | 🔸 Understanding of HTTP response        |
| 6️⃣      | ESP32 parses the response and turns **GPIO 5 HIGH/LOW** to control the relay | ESP32 Microcontroller | 🔸 Arduino C++, GPIO control             |
| 7️⃣      | Relay switches the 230V AC power to bulb ON/OFF                              | Relay module          | 🔸 Electrical wiring (basic electronics) |
| 8️⃣      | Bulb responds and turns ON or OFF in real-time                               | Bulb + power supply   | 🔸 Safe handling of AC components        |

| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| ESP32 is wired correctly to SIM900A              | ✅  |
| SIM900A is powered via 5V, 2A supply (not ESP32) | ✅      |
| SIM card (Airtel IoT) is inserted into SIM900A   | ✅     |
| Antenna is attached to SIM900A                   | ✅     |
| `RX`, `TX` connected properly (crossed)          | ✅      |
| Arduino IDE is ready, board = `ESP32 Dev Module` | ✅     |
| Port (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0`) is selected           | ✅ |
| You’ve replaced this URL:                        |            |




sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0

wiring is done. red and green lights are on. esp32 tx connect with RXD3.3V and esp32 rx connect with TXD 3.3v. esp gnd connect with gnd of sim900a. esp gnd connect with one relay gnd. relay in pin connects with gpio5. relay vcc connect with esp32 vin.
why still not working even relay lights are on.
